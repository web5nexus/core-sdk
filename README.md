## Getting Started

To get started with the Web5 Nexus SDK, follow the steps below:

1. Install the SDK package via npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install @web5nexus/web3auth-core

   ```
   
2. Import the SDK into your project:
   ```typescript
   import Web5Nexus from '@web5nexus/web3auth-core';
   ```
   
3. Initialize the Web5 Nexus SDK with your credentials:
